                        Ambition is crucial since it will determine how our future is shaped. A student's ambition propels them forward and transforms them into extraordinary people. As college students, we need ambition since we cannot possibly succeed without the drive to do so. College students are not required to do anything by anyone other than their parents. Perhaps some students are motivated to do well in school by the thousands they are spending. Some people have the urge to have a better life than they did as children. Whatever the motivation behind a student's aspirations, all paths ultimately lead to achievement. <br>
                        My primary ambition is to be lead sofware engineer and use my skill as stated <a href="Skills.html">HERE</a> to make an impact in my society especially in social amenities which are known to be using manual ways to offer their services. Being in a third world country, I look forward to playing a role in ensuring technology reaches our people around the country. <br>
